# 📝 Training Records

This directory contains **templates for training records** used in **AITL Training**.

Training records provide **objective, auditable evidence** that education and training
have resulted in **verified competence**, not merely attendance.

- 📌 **Objective evidence** of completed education and training  
- 🔗 **Traceability** between:
  - Training plans  
  - Verification activities  
  - Confirmed competence  
- ✍ **Explicit responsibility acknowledgment** by trainees  

These records ensure that competence claims are **defensible and reviewable**.
