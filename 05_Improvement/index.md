# 🔄 Improvement

This directory describes **continuous improvement and corrective-action concepts**
related to **AITL education and training**.

It defines **how the training system itself is reviewed, corrected, and improved**
to ensure ongoing competence and responsibility assurance.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Improvement Activities

Documents in this directory explain:

- 🔍 **How training feedback is collected and reviewed**
- 🧭 **How gaps in competence are identified and addressed**
- 🔄 **How lessons learned are reflected in training updates**
- 🛡 **How responsibility boundaries are reinforced through improvement**

Improvement activities focus on the **training system**, not on assigning blame
to individuals.

## 🧩 Scope of Improvement

Improvement under AITL may include:

- Refinement of training objectives or scope  
- Updates to training architecture or learning paths  
- Clarification of verification criteria  
- Strengthening of responsibility or escalation rules  

🚫 This directory does **not** redefine technical designs or implementations.

---

## 🔗 Relation to Training Records and Verification

Improvement activities are typically triggered by:

- 📄 Training records indicating **conditional or failed verification**
- ✅ Verification findings identifying **systematic gaps**
- 🔁 Repeated misunderstandings of responsibility boundaries  

Inputs from:
- `03_Training_Record`  
- `04_Verification`  

are used as **objective evidence** for improvement decisions.

## 📘 ISO 9001 Alignment

This directory supports:

- 📌 **ISO 9001 Clause 10 (Improvement)**  
- 📌 Corrective actions based on verified evidence  
- 📌 Continual improvement of education and competence assurance processes  

All improvements must remain aligned with the **AITL Training Policy**.

> Improvement under AITL strengthens *how competence is assured*,  
> not *who is responsible*.  
> Responsibility for engineering decisions always remains human-owned.
