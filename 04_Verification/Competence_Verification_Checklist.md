# ✅ Competence Verification Checklist (AITL)

This document defines the **competence verification checklist** for **AITL-based education and training**.

It is used to confirm that training outcomes are **demonstrated, explainable,
and responsibility-preserving**, not merely completed.

This checklist is aligned with **ISO 9001 Clause 7.2 (Competence)** and is applicable
to **all roles** defined in the AITL Training Plans.

---

## 1️⃣ Purpose

The purpose of this checklist is to:

- ✅ Verify that training has resulted in **actual competence**, not just attendance  
- 🧭 Confirm that **AITL responsibility boundaries** are correctly understood  
- 🚫 Prevent unsafe delegation of **design or control responsibility** to AI or tools  
- 📘 Provide an **auditable record** of competence verification  

This checklist is used in conjunction with training records defined in  
`03_Training_Record`.

---

## 2️⃣ Verification Principles

Competence verification under AITL is based on the following principles:

- 🧠 **Explainability over automation**  
- ⚖ **Responsibility over convenience**  
- 📐 **Causal understanding over pattern recognition**  
- 🛡 **Human accountability over AI authority**  

Verification must confirm **understanding and judgment**,  
not familiarity with tools or frameworks.

---

## 3️⃣ General Verification Items (All Roles)

The following items apply to **all roles**.

| Item | Verification Question | Pass / Fail | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GV-1 | Can the trainee explain AITL responsibility separation (PID / FSM / NN–RL / LLM) without ambiguity? |  |  |
| GV-2 | Can the trainee clearly state where AI assistance is **not allowed**? |  |  |
| GV-3 | Can the trainee identify who is responsible for **final design decisions**? |  |  |
| GV-4 | Can the trainee explain system behavior using **physical and causal reasoning**? |  |  |
| GV-5 | Can the trainee explain why **LLMs are restricted to non-real-time use**? |  |  |

---

## 4️⃣ Design Engineer Verification Items

Applicable to trainees following `Plan_Design_Engineer`.

| Item | Verification Question | Pass / Fail | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| DE-1 | Can the trainee justify architectural decisions based on **physical constraints**? |  |  |
| DE-2 | Can the trainee explain why **AI outputs are non-authoritative**? |  |  |
| DE-3 | Can the trainee identify scenarios requiring **design recovery**? |  |  |
| DE-4 | Can the trainee explain risks of delegating **design judgment to AI**? |  |  |
| DE-5 | Can the trainee communicate **design boundaries** to stakeholders? |  |  |

---

## 5️⃣ Control Engineer Verification Items

Applicable to trainees following `Plan_Control_Engineer`.

| Item | Verification Question | Pass / Fail | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| CE-1 | Can the trainee explain **PID control behavior** and stability reasoning? |  |  |
| CE-2 | Can the trainee explain **FSM supervision** and mode transitions? |  |  |
| CE-3 | Can the trainee identify when **adaptive assistance must be disabled**? |  |  |
| CE-4 | Can the trainee recognize **loss of controllability or unsafe operation**? |  |  |
| CE-5 | Can the trainee justify **exclusion of LLMs from real-time control**? |  |  |

---

## 6️⃣ AI System Architect Verification Items

Applicable to trainees following `Plan_AI_System_Architect`.

| Item | Verification Question | Pass / Fail | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI-1 | Can the trainee explain AI’s role as **design-time support only**? |  |  |
| AI-2 | Can the trainee identify **prohibited AI use cases** in control systems? |  |  |
| AI-3 | Can the trainee explain how **AI outputs must be reviewed and validated**? |  |  |
| AI-4 | Can the trainee explain **responsibility boundaries** between AI and engineers? |  |  |
| AI-5 | Can the trainee explain **escalation to design recovery processes**? |  |  |

---

## 7️⃣ Verification Outcome

Verification is considered **successful** when:

- All applicable items are marked as **Pass**  
- Any limitations or conditions are **explicitly documented**  
- Responsibility boundaries are **clearly acknowledged** by the trainee  

❌ Partial completion or tool proficiency alone is **not sufficient**.

---

## 8️⃣ Use in Training Records

Verification results shall be:

- 🔗 Referenced in training records (`03_Training_Record`)  
- 🔍 Reviewed during audits or internal reviews  
- 🔄 Used as input for **improvement or corrective actions** if gaps are identified  

---

## 9️⃣ Summary

This checklist ensures that:

- Training outcomes are **verifiable and explainable**  
- AI does **not obscure engineering responsibility**  
- AITL principles are **consistently applied across roles**  

> 🛡 Competence under AITL is defined by  
> **understanding, judgment, and accountability**.
