# ✅ Competence Verification

This directory defines **how training outcomes are verified** under **AITL Training**.

Verification confirms that education has resulted in **actual, accountable competence**,
not just exposure to materials or completion of training sessions.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Verification

Verification documents are used to:

- ✅ **Confirm actual competence**, not assumed understanding  
- 🧭 Ensure **responsibility boundaries** are correctly understood  
- 🚫 Prevent **unsafe delegation** of judgment to AI or tools  

Verification is the **decision point** for recognizing training completion.

## 🧠 Verification Focus Areas

Competence verification focuses on the trainee’s ability to demonstrate:

- 🧠 **Explainability**  
  - Can the trainee explain decisions, assumptions, and boundaries in their own words?

- ⚖ **Judgment**  
  - Can the trainee identify safe vs. unsafe choices and escalation points?

- 🛡 **Accountability**  
  - Does the trainee clearly accept responsibility appropriate to their role?

Verification is role-specific and aligned with AITL responsibility separation.

---

## 🔗 Relation to Training Records

Results of verification:

- Are explicitly referenced in **training records**
- Form the **objective evidence** required by ISO 9001 Clause 7.2
- Determine **Pass / Conditional / Fail** outcomes for training recognition

Without verification, training is **not considered complete**.

> Verification evaluates *who is accountable*, not *what tools were used*.  
> Under AITL, responsibility always remains with qualified human engineers.
