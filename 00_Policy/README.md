# 📜 Policy

This directory contains the **top-level education and training policy** for **AITL Training**.

It defines the **authoritative principles** that govern how AITL-related knowledge is  
**taught, evaluated, verified, and maintained** across all training activities.

---

## 🎯 Scope of This Policy

Documents in this directory define:

- 🔒 **Non-negotiable principles** of AITL education  
- 🧭 **Clear separation of responsibilities** between:
  - Control (PID / FSM)  
  - AI-based assistance (NN / RL)  
  - Design-time intelligence (LLM)  
- 📘 Alignment with **ISO 9001 Clause 7.2 (Competence)**  

These principles exist to preserve **engineering accountability, safety, and causal clarity**.

---

## 🧱 Policy Authority

This policy represents the **highest-level normative reference** within the AITL Training repository.

Accordingly:

- All **training architecture**  
- All **role-based training plans**  
- All **training records**  
- All **verification and competence criteria**  

**must comply with this policy without exception.**

No lower-level document may override, reinterpret, or dilute the principles defined here.

---

## ⚠️ Design Responsibility Statement

AITL education explicitly **does not transfer design responsibility** to:

- AI tools  
- Automation frameworks  
- Educational materials themselves  

Training under this policy ensures that **human engineers remain accountable** for:

- Design intent  
- Engineering judgment  
- Safety boundaries  
- Final decisions  

---

## 🔖 Relation to ISO 9001

This policy supports:

- 📌 **ISO 9001 Clause 7.2 (Competence)**  
- 📌 Traceability of education, training, and verification  
- 📌 Auditable separation between *education*, *assistance*, and *design responsibility*  

It serves as the **policy anchor** for audits, reviews, and continuous improvement activities.
