# 🔗 Reference

This directory provides **reference links to the main Samizo-AITL repositories**.

It exists to clearly distinguish **education and training documentation**
from **technical implementation repositories**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Directory

This directory exists to:

- 🏷 **Explicitly declare the Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**  
- 🚫 **Avoid duplication of technical content**  
- 🧭 Maintain **clear separation between education and implementation**  

It serves as a **navigation and declaration layer**, not a content layer.

---

## 📘 Usage Principles

- This directory contains **references only**  
- No original technical explanations, designs, or implementations are created here  
- All technical details must be maintained in the **primary Samizo-AITL repositories**

Educational documents may **reference** these repositories,
but must **not replicate or reinterpret** their technical content.

---

## 🛡 Governance Note

This separation ensures that:

- Technical changes occur in **one authoritative location**
- Training materials remain **stable, auditable, and traceable**
- Responsibility for implementation is **never obscured by documentation copies**

---

> 🧠 **Note**  
> This directory defines *where truth lives*, not *how systems are built*.  
> Under AITL, education references implementation — it does not replace it.
