# Training Plans

This directory contains **role-based training plans** for AITL-based systems.

Each training plan defines:
- Role responsibility and authority
- Required training layers
- Competence objectives
- Verification expectations

The plans in this directory **do not duplicate technical documentation**.  
They define *what must be understood and explained*, not how to implement it.

All plans are aligned with:
- AITL responsibility separation
- ISO 9001 Clause 7.2 (Competence)

## Notes

- The **Education & Training Needs Matrix** is the **entry point for management and auditors**.

- Completion is validated in:
  - `03_Training_Record`
  - `04_Verification`
