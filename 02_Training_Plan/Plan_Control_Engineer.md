# 🎛 Training Plan: Control Engineer (AITL)

This document defines the **role-based training plan** for **Control Engineers**
working with systems based on **AITL (Architecture for Integrated Technology Logic)**.

This plan is aligned with **ISO 9001 Clause 7.2 (Competence)** and focuses on
preserving **real-time control responsibility** while enabling **supervised use**
of adaptive and AI-assisted methods.

---

## 1️⃣ Role Definition

A **Control Engineer** under AITL is responsible for:

- ⚡ Designing and validating **real-time control loops**
- 🛡 Ensuring **system stability, safety, and deterministic behavior**
- 📐 Defining **operating envelopes and safe modes**
- 🤝 Cooperating with supervisory and design-level functions  
  **without relinquishing control authority**

🔑 Control Engineers are **directly responsible** for **real-time system behavior**.

---

## 2️⃣ Training Objectives

After completing this training, a Control Engineer shall be able to:

- Explain control behavior based on **physical models and assumptions**
- Design and tune **PID-based control loops** with clear stability justification
- Explain the role of **FSMs** in supervision and mode management
- Identify conditions under which **adaptation must be limited or disabled**
- Clearly explain why **LLMs are excluded from real-time control**

---

## 3️⃣ Required Training Layers

Control Engineers must complete training in the following **AITL layers**.

---

### 🧪 Layer 1: Physical and System Constraints

**Required competence:**

- Understand physical limits affecting **controllability**
- Identify constraints that **cannot be compensated by control**
- Recognize **model breakdown conditions**

---

### 🎯 Layer 2: Models and Real-Time Control

**Required competence:**

- Develop and validate **control-oriented models**
- Design and tune **PID controllers**
- Analyze **stability, response, and robustness**

**Key rule:**
- ⚡ **Real-time control authority resides exclusively in PID and FSM**

---

### 🔄 Layer 3: Supervisory Control (FSM)

**Required competence:**

- Design **FSM-based supervision logic**
- Define **safe mode transitions**
- Handle **faults, degradation, and recovery**

**Key rule:**
- 🧭 FSM determines **when control modes may change**

---

### 🔁 Layer 4: Adaptive Assistance (Bounded)

**Required competence:**

- Understand **NN / RL** as adaptive assist mechanisms
- Define **explicit bounds and safety limits**
- Recognize when adaptation **threatens stability or responsibility**

**Key rule:**
- 🔒 Adaptive methods may assist but **must not override control logic**

---

### 🧠 Layer 5: Design-Time Intelligence (LLM)

**Required competence:**

- Use **LLMs for offline analysis and review only**
- Interpret logs and trends **without delegating decisions**
- Communicate **limitations of AI-assisted analysis**

**Key rule:**
- 📘 LLMs are strictly **non-real-time and non-authoritative**

---

### 🧯 Layer 6: Boundary Confirmation and Recovery

**Required competence:**

- Detect **loss of controllability**
- Decide **when to stop control action**
- Escalate to **design recovery processes**

---

## 4️⃣ Learning Materials

Training materials shall be selected from the **Samizo-AITL main repositories**,
including:

- 📘 Control architecture documentation
- 🎛 PID / FSM PoC implementations
- 🧪 Control playground demonstrations
- 🧯 Envelope control and recovery concepts

🚫 This plan does **not** introduce alternative control frameworks.

---

## 5️⃣ Verification Criteria

Competence verification shall confirm that the Control Engineer can:

- Justify control designs using **physical and control reasoning**
- Explain **FSM supervision and mode transitions**
- Identify unsafe use of **adaptive or AI-based methods**
- Demonstrate awareness of **responsibility boundaries**

**Verification methods may include:**

- Design explanation  
- Control response interpretation  
- Scenario-based discussion  
- Checklist-based assessment  

---

## 6️⃣ Training Records

Completion of this training shall be recorded using:

- 📄 Templates defined in `03_Training_Record`

Records must indicate:

- Training layers completed  
- Verification outcome  
- Verifier identity  

---

## 7️⃣ Completion Criteria

A Control Engineer is considered **trained under AITL** when:

- All required layers are completed  
- Verification criteria are met  
- **Real-time control responsibility** is clearly understood and accepted  

---

## 8️⃣ Summary

This training plan ensures that Control Engineers:

- ⚡ Retain **full authority over real-time behavior**
- 🤝 Use adaptive and AI-assisted methods **responsibly**
- 🛡 Protect **system stability and safety**

> 🔑 AITL-based control depends on **accountable engineers**, not autonomous intelligence.
