# Education & Training Needs Matrix  
**Rows:** Training Items (Public Repositories)  
**Columns:** Required Job Competencies / Skills  

This matrix defines **which competencies are covered by which public AITL repositories**.  
It is intended for **AITL adoption decisions, training gap analysis, and management / audit explanation**.

---

## Legend

- ◎ **Mandatory** — Can take full responsibility independently  
- ○ **Important** — Can perform tasks autonomously  
- △ **Basic** — Conceptual / explanatory understanding  
- — **Not applicable**

## Competency Definitions (Columns)

| ID | Competency / Skill | Business-Level Definition |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | Physical Principles | Can explain phenomena causally (including V–I characteristics) |
| S2 | Modeling | Can build models using equations or block diagrams with explicit assumptions |
| S3 | Control Theory (PID) | Can design gains with stability and performance justification |
| S4 | State Control (FSM) | Can define states, transitions, and fault states explicitly |
| S5 | AI Control (NN / RL) | Can define objectives, metrics, and deviation handling |
| S6 | LLM Utilization | Can restrict LLM usage to design support with validation rules |
| S7 | System Integration | Can specify responsibility separation (Control × AI × Safety) |
| S8 | Implementation | Can build reproducible implementations (Python / Git / EDA) |
| S9 | Verification | Can define pass/fail criteria, tests, and logs |
| S10 | Documentation | Can maintain traceability (Requirements → Design → Verification) |

## How to Use This Matrix (For Companies)

- **Control & Safety deployment**  
  Focus on `EduController`, `AITL Controller A-Type`, `AI Control Safety Package`  
  → **S3, S4, S7 must be ◎**

- **Physics / Device-driven development**  
  Focus on `Edusemi-v4x`, `V–I Control ASIC`  
  → **S1, S2 must be ◎**

- **Implementation & EDA flow**  
  Focus on `SemiDevKit`, `openlane2-sram`  
  → **S8 and S9 must be satisfied**

- **AITL governance & explanation responsibility**  
  Use `portal` and `aitl-training`  
  → **S7 and S10 must be satisfied**

## Explicit Notes (Business Use)

- This matrix is built **exclusively from public repositories**.
- “Completed reading” is not sufficient.  
  **Competence must be confirmed via S9 (Verification).**
- If mandatory (◎) competencies are not met,  
  **deployment to production work is not permitted.**
