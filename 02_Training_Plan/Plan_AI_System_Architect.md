# 🤖 Training Plan: AI System Architect (AITL)

This document defines the **role-based training plan** for **AI System Architects**
working with systems based on **AITL (Architecture for Integrated Technology Logic)**.

This plan is aligned with **ISO 9001 Clause 7.2 (Competence)** and is explicitly designed
to ensure that AI technologies are applied **without violating control authority,
design responsibility, or accountability**.

---

## 1️⃣ Role Definition

An **AI System Architect** under AITL is responsible for:

- 🧩 Designing how AI technologies are **integrated into engineering systems**
- 🚧 Defining **where AI may assist and where it is explicitly prohibited**
- 🛡 Ensuring AI usage does **not obscure responsibility or decision ownership**
- 🧠 Supporting engineers through **analysis, review, and design-time assistance**

🚫 This role **does not own real-time behavior**  
🚫 This role **does not make final design decisions**

---

## 2️⃣ Training Objectives

After completing this training, an AI System Architect shall be able to:

- Explain **AITL responsibility separation** without ambiguity  
- Clearly distinguish **design-time intelligence** from **real-time control**  
- Identify **prohibited AI use cases** in control and safety-critical systems  
- Design AI workflows that **preserve human accountability**  
- Communicate AI **capabilities and limitations** to engineers and management  

---

## 3️⃣ Required Training Layers

AI System Architects must complete training in the following **AITL layers**.

---

### 🧪 Layer 1: Physical and System Constraints

**Required competence:**

- Understand physical constraints that AI **cannot override**
- Recognize where abstraction **hides critical physical assumptions**
- Explain why AI **cannot compensate for missing physics**

---

### 🎛 Layer 2: Models and Control Foundations

**Required competence:**

- Understand the role of **control models and PID-based control**
- Explain why AI is **not a replacement for real-time control**
- Recognize risks of **AI-driven control substitution**

**Key rule:**
- 🚫 AI **shall not** replace control models or control logic

---

### 🔄 Layer 3: Supervisory Control and State Management

**Required competence:**

- Understand **FSM-based supervision**
- Explain how supervision governs **permission for adaptation**
- Recognize escalation paths when assumptions break

**Key rule:**
- 🛡 AI operates **under supervision**, never as a supervisor of control authority

---

### 🔁 Layer 4: Adaptive Assistance (Bounded)

**Required competence:**

- Understand **NN / RL** as **bounded adaptive assist mechanisms**
- Identify explicit **safety and responsibility bounds**
- Recognize failure modes caused by **uncontrolled adaptation**

**Key rule:**
- 🔒 AI adaptation is **conditional, bounded, and revocable**

---

### 🧠 Layer 5: Design-Time Intelligence (LLM)

**Required competence:**

- Design workflows where **LLMs support analysis and review**
- Ensure LLM usage is strictly **non-real-time**
- Treat LLM outputs as **non-authoritative reference material**

**Key rule:**
- 📘 LLMs assist engineers; **they do not decide for them**

---

### 🧯 Layer 6: Boundary Confirmation and Design Recovery

**Required competence:**

- Identify when **AI-assisted assumptions are invalid**
- Support escalation to **design recovery processes**
- Participate in **corrective action and improvement activities**

---

## 4️⃣ Prohibited AI Use Cases

AI System Architects must be able to **clearly identify and prevent**:

- 🚫 Use of LLMs in **real-time control loops**
- 🚫 Autonomous AI decision-making **without human accountability**
- 🚫 Replacement of **PID or FSM logic** with AI models
- 🚫 AI systems that **obscure responsibility attribution**
- 🚫 AI-generated outputs used **without verification**

---

## 5️⃣ Learning Materials

Training materials shall be selected from the **Samizo-AITL main repositories**,
including:

- 📘 AITL architecture documentation  
- 🎛 Control and supervisory architecture explanations  
- 🧯 Design recovery and legacy case studies  
- 🛡 AI safety and responsibility discussions  

🚫 This training plan does **not** promote AI-first or tool-driven design.

---

## 6️⃣ Verification Criteria

Competence verification shall confirm that the AI System Architect can:

- Explain **AI’s permitted and prohibited roles** under AITL  
- Design AI workflows that **preserve responsibility boundaries**  
- Identify **unsafe or misleading AI integration patterns**  
- Communicate AI **limitations clearly** to non-AI engineers  

**Verification methods may include:**

- Scenario analysis  
- Architecture explanation  
- Checklist-based assessment  
- Design review discussion  

---

## 7️⃣ Training Records

Completion of this training shall be recorded using:

- 📄 Templates defined in `03_Training_Record`

Records must indicate:

- Training layers completed  
- Verification outcome  
- Verifier identity  

---

## 8️⃣ Completion Criteria

An AI System Architect is considered **trained under AITL** when:

- All required layers are completed  
- Verification criteria are satisfied  
- Responsibility boundaries are **explicitly acknowledged**

---

## 9️⃣ Summary

This training plan ensures that AI System Architects:

- Integrate AI **without displacing engineering judgment**
- Preserve **accountability and safety**
- Support, rather than replace, **human decision-making**

> 🧠 Under AITL, AI is a **design-time assistant**, not a decision authority.
