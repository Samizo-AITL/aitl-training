# 📘 Samizo-AITL Education & Training Program Plan

This document defines the **official education and training program plan**
based on the **AITL Education & Training Needs Matrix**.

It translates **required competencies** into **concrete training programs**
with defined materials, instructors, duration, and execution rules.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This program plan is used to:

- Execute AITL education in a **structured and auditable manner**
- Ensure coverage of required competencies (S1–S10)
- Support **ISO 9001 Clause 7.2 (Competence)** compliance
- Serve as the **operational plan** for training delivery

Completion of training programs alone is **not sufficient**;  
verification and records are mandatory.

## ✅ Completion Rules

Training is considered **complete** only when all of the following are satisfied:

1. Training program completed  
2. **Competence Verification Checklist: Pass**  
3. Training Record completed and signed  

Attendance or self-study alone **does not constitute completion**.

## 🛡 Governance Notes

- Training materials are limited to **Single Source of Truth repositories**
- Training time is the **minimum required duration**
- Any reduction requires documented justification and approval
- Verification results drive **improvement and corrective actions**
