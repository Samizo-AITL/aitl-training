# Training Plans

This directory contains **role-based training plans** for AITL-based systems.

Each training plan defines:
- Role responsibility and authority
- Required training layers
- Competence objectives
- Verification expectations

The plans in this directory **do not duplicate technical documentation**.
They define *what must be understood and explained*, not how to implement it.

All plans are aligned with:
- AITL responsibility separation
- ISO 9001 Clause 7.2 (Competence)
