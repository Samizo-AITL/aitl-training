# AITL Training

This repository provides **education and training documentation** based on  
**AITL (Architecture for Integrated Technology Logic)**,  
organized with **ISO 9001–style competence management, training structure, and responsibility separation** in mind.

This repository does **not** contain technical implementations or source code.  
It defines **how AITL-related knowledge is trained, verified, and maintained** from an education and competence perspective.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Define **training objectives and competence requirements** for AITL-based design activities
- Organize educational materials into a **traceable and auditable training structure**
- Support education and training aligned with **ISO 9001 Clause 7.2 (Competence)**
- Enable organizations to adopt AITL **without compromising design responsibility or accountability**

---

## Scope

This repository covers:

- Training policy and educational principles
- Training architecture and learning paths
- Role-based training plans
- Training records and verification criteria
- Concepts for continuous improvement and corrective actions

This repository does **not** replace or duplicate:

- Physical modeling
- Control system design
- Implementation repositories
- Proof-of-concept (PoC) or experimental systems

These remain the **Single Source of Truth** within the main Samizo-AITL repositories.

## Relation to Samizo-AITL

AITL is based on a strict separation of responsibilities:

- **Real-time control**: PID / FSM  
- **Adaptive assist**: NN / RL (bounded and supervised)  
- **Design-time intelligence**: LLM (non-real-time use only)

This repository documents **how these architectural principles are taught, understood, and verified**,  
not how they are technically implemented.

---

## Intended Audience

This repository is intended for:

- Control system designers
- Semiconductor and MEMS engineers
- AI-assisted system architects
- Engineering managers responsible for education, training, and competence management

This is **not an introductory tutorial**.  
It assumes prior engineering knowledge and focuses on **design responsibility and competence assurance**.
