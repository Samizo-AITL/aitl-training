# AITL Training

This repository provides **education and training documentation** based on  
**AITL (Architecture for Integrated Technology Logic)**,  
organized with **ISO9001-style competence, training, and responsibility separation** in mind.

This repository does **not** contain technical implementations or source code.  
It defines **how AITL-related knowledge is trained, verified, and maintained**.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Define **training objectives and competence requirements** for AITL-based design
- Organize education materials into a **traceable training structure**
- Support **ISO9001 Clause 7.2 (Competence)**-oriented education and training
- Enable organizations to adopt AITL **without compromising design responsibility**

---

## Scope

This repository covers:

- Training policy and educational principles
- Training architecture and learning paths
- Role-based training plans
- Training records and verification criteria
- Continuous improvement and corrective-action concepts

This repository does **not** replace:
- Physical modeling
- Control design
- Implementation repositories
- PoC or experimental systems

Those remain the **Single Source of Truth** in the main Samizo-AITL repositories.

---

## Relation to Samizo-AITL

AITL follows a strict responsibility separation:

- Real-time control: PID / FSM
- Adaptive assist: NN / RL (bounded)
- Design-time intelligence: LLM (non-real-time only)

This repository documents **how these principles are taught and verified**,  
not how they are implemented.

---

## Intended Audience

- Control system designers
- Semiconductor / MEMS engineers
- AI-assisted system architects
- Engineering managers responsible for education and competence

This is **not an introductory tutorial**.

## License

Documentation is provided under a **hybrid license model** consistent with Samizo-AITL.
