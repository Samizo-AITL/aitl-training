# 🎓 AITL Training

[![Back to Portal (EN)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Back%20to%20Portal-0B5FFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=homeassistant&logoColor=white)](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/portal/en/)

This repository provides **education and training documentation** based on  
**AITL (Architecture for Integrated Technology Logic)**,  
organized with **ISO 9001–style competence management, structured training, and clear responsibility separation** in mind.

⚠️ This repository does **not** contain technical implementations or source code.  
It defines **how AITL-related knowledge is trained, verified, and maintained** from an **education and competence assurance perspective**.

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- 🎯 Define **training objectives and competence requirements** for AITL-based design activities  
- 🧭 Organize educational materials into a **traceable, auditable training structure**  
- 📘 Support education and training aligned with **ISO 9001 Clause 7.2 (Competence)**  
- 🛡 Enable organizations to adopt AITL **without compromising design responsibility or accountability**

---

## 📦 Scope

This repository covers:

- 📜 Training policy and educational principles  
- 🧱 Training architecture and learning paths  
- 👥 Role-based training plans  
- 📝 Training records and verification criteria  
- 🔄 Concepts for continuous improvement and corrective actions  

This repository does **not** replace or duplicate:

- Physical modeling  
- Control system design  
- Implementation repositories  
- Proof-of-concept (PoC) or experimental systems  

These remain the **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** within the main Samizo-AITL repositories.

## 🗂 Directory Overview

The directory structure itself reflects the **AITL education and competence framework**.

### 📁 Policy
- [`00_Policy/`](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/aitl-training/00_Policy/)
- Defines **non-negotiable principles**, responsibility separation, and education policy  
- 🔖 Top-level reference aligned with **ISO 9001 Clause 7.2**

---

### 📁 Training Architecture
- [`01_Training_Architecture/`](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/aitl-training/01_Training_Architecture/)
- Defines the **ordered learning structure**  
  *(Physical → Control → Intelligence → Boundary & Recovery)*  
- 🧠 Ensures **causal, responsibility-preserving education**

---

### 📁 Training Plans (Role-based)
- [`02_Training_Plan/`](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/aitl-training/02_Training_Plan/)
- Role-specific competence definitions and learning scope:
  - 🛠 Design Engineer  
  - 🎛 Control Engineer  
  - 🤖 AI System Architect  
  - 🧑‍💼 (Optional) Engineering Manager  
- 📌 Specifies **what must be understood and explained**, not how to implement

---

### 📁 Training Records
- [`03_Training_Record/`](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/aitl-training/03_Training_Record/)
- Templates for **objective evidence of training and competence**  
- 🗃 Supports audits, reviews, and traceability

---

### 📁 Verification
- [`04_Verification/`](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/aitl-training/04_Verification/)
- Defines **competence verification criteria**  
- ✅ Confirms understanding, judgment, and accountability  
- 🚫 Prevents unsafe delegation to AI or automated tools

---

### 📁 Improvement
- [`05_Improvement/`](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/aitl-training/05_Improvement/)
- Concepts for **continuous improvement and corrective actions**  
- 📈 Supports **ISO 9001 Clause 10 (Improvement)**

---

### 📁 Reference
- [`99_Reference/`](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/aitl-training/99_Reference/)
- 🔗 Links to **main Samizo-AITL repositories**  
- 🏷 Declares the **Single Source of Truth**  
- ❌ No original technical content is created here

## 🧠 Relation to Samizo-AITL

AITL is based on a strict separation of responsibilities:

- ⚡ **Real-time control**: PID / FSM  
- 🔁 **Adaptive assist**: NN / RL *(bounded and supervised)*  
- 🧩 **Design-time intelligence**: LLM *(non-real-time use only)*  

This repository documents **how these architectural principles are taught, understood, and verified**,  
**not** how they are technically implemented.

---

## 👥 Intended Audience

This repository is intended for:

- 🎛 Control system designers  
- 🧪 Semiconductor and MEMS engineers  
- 🤖 AI-assisted system architects  
- 🧑‍💼 Engineering managers responsible for education, training, and competence management  

🚧 This is **not an introductory tutorial**.  
It assumes prior engineering knowledge and focuses on **design responsibility and competence assurance**.
