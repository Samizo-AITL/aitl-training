# Training Architecture

This directory defines the **overall training architecture** for AITL-based education.

Documents in this directory describe:
- The ordered learning structure (Physical → Control → Intelligence)
- Responsibility-preserving learning progression
- Prerequisite relationships between training layers

This architecture ensures that training:
- Follows causal reality
- Avoids tool-driven or AI-first learning
- Supports traceable competence development

All role-based training plans reference this architecture.
