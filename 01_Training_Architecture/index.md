# 🧱 Training Architecture

This directory defines the **overall training architecture** for **AITL-based education**.

It specifies **how learning is structured, ordered, and constrained** to ensure  
that competence is developed in a **causal, responsibility-preserving manner**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Training Architecture

The training architecture exists to:

- 🧭 Establish an **ordered learning structure**  
  *(Physical → Control → Intelligence → Boundary & Recovery)*  
- 🧠 Preserve **engineering responsibility and causal understanding**  
- 🔗 Define **prerequisite relationships** between training layers  
- 📘 Enable **traceable and auditable competence development**

---

## 🧩 Core Principles

Documents in this directory describe:

- 📐 The **mandatory learning order**:
  - Physical domain understanding  
  - Control logic and real-time behavior  
  - Intelligence-assisted functions  
- 🔒 A **responsibility-preserving learning progression**  
- 🔗 Explicit **prerequisite relationships** between training layers  

No training content may bypass or reorder these layers.

---

## ⚠️ Architectural Constraints

This training architecture ensures that education:

- ⛓ **Follows causal reality**, not abstraction-first narratives  
- 🚫 **Avoids tool-driven or AI-first learning paths**  
- 🛡 Prevents premature reliance on AI without physical or control grounding  
- 📊 Supports **objective, traceable competence evaluation**

---

## 🔄 Relation to Role-Based Training Plans

All **role-based training plans**:

- Must explicitly reference this training architecture  
- Must declare which layers are required, optional, or out-of-scope  
- Must respect the defined **learning order and prerequisites**

No role-based plan may redefine or shortcut the architecture described here.

---

## 🔖 Relation to Policy and ISO 9001

This training architecture:

- Is subordinate to the **AITL Training Policy**  
- Supports **ISO 9001 Clause 7.2 (Competence)** through structured learning paths  
- Enables consistent verification and improvement across roles and organizations  

It acts as the **structural backbone** for all downstream training documentation.
